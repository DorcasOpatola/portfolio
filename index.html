					<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
					<p>I am a professional Virtual Assistant. I work with sigma.ai to train AI on the Yoruba language, native to African countries like Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon. I am a google crowdsource contributor, a platform owned by google that helps train google's AI to become smarter. I've always fancied remote work, its one of the reasons I went into tech. I graduated 2021, with a second class upper degree in BTech. Pure and Applied Chemistry. My studies as a chemist developed in me an analytical mindset and approach to problems, which has being of help in my tech journey.</p>
					<p>Life is short. Life is short. LIFE IS SHORT! Too many people hate you already, dont waste your life hating on yourself too. No one is coming to save you. The sooner you get started on saving yourself, the better for you.</p>
